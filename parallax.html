	  <h1>Styracosaurus</h1>
		<p>Not a Triceratops, but it’s in the same classification! It’s a Ceratopsian, which is any herbivore in the Cretacious period with a bony frill. Unlike the Triceratops, Styracosaurus only has one pronounced horn on the end of its head. Its frill makes up for it, being covered in sharp horns!</p>

	  <h1>Here’s your Triceratops!</h1>
		<p>The word “tri” means three, and how many horns does this beast have? Unlike the Styracosaurus, Triceratrops lacks horns on it's frill.</p>

	  <h1>Diabloceratops</h1>
		<p>A smaller Ceratopcian standing at 2 meters tall. It's armed with 2 sharp horns that curve upwards on its head, while another set curve outwards on its frill.</p>

	  <h1>Mercuriceratops</h1>
		<p>This isn't a Triceratops despite it's three horns. Look at the base of the frill, it has a protrusion. It's horns are also signifcatly smaller.</p>

	 <h1>Pachyrhinosaurus</h1>
	<p>"Where's it's horns?" you may be asking. Much like Pachycephalosaurus, this Ceratopsian has a thick bonned plate down it's snout. It does have two horns lining up it's frill but those are hardly usable due to being angled. </p>
